This is project that I create to learn pygame by making a simple game. I made this for my big assignment in Open Source Technology class.

<b>What is the pygame?</b> 

Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
Pygame adds functionality on top of the excellent SDL library.
This allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language.
